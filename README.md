Let the master branch only contain the library and important files

Branch off the master to make your own code for the robot. If you're writing code that's only for the VF Library, then only use that in your branch, no need to include unused files and folders. However, maintain the same structure so it's easy to navigate between branches.


In case you want to make a change, add a file or fix a bug to the main library, do it on a separate branch and then submit a Pull Request when you're ready to merge. If you do this, I'll try to review the code and then add it to the library if suitable.

Feel free to propose changes or report issues in the issues section with a clear explanation of what's wrong, even if you've told me in person.
